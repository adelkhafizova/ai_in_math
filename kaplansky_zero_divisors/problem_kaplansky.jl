    """
    Main greedy search algorithm.
    It starts and ends with some construction

    Algorithm (taiko concept taken from https://mineyev.web.illinois.edu/art/top-geom-uzd-origami.pdf):

    Input: A string P corresponding to a partition of the edge set.

    (1) Check if current partition is orientable, no-fold, and no-pattern. If not, remove 2-cells until it is.

    Kinds of bad things:
    1. Partition error - remove bad 2-cells and try again
    2. Orientation error - try flipping orientation of bad 2-cell, otherwise remove it

    Note that partition and orientation errors will halt further graph construction, so modifications are made at the string level.

    3. Fold - remove bad 2-cell
    4. Pattern - remove bad 2-cell

    No-fold and no-pattern are checked after graph construction, so modifications are made at the graph level.
    Note that removing a 2-cell will never make it violate partition or orientation conditions any more than it already does.

    (2) Add allowed 2-cells randomly until structure is a taiko. Ensure after each step that the structure is still orientable, no-fold, and no-pattern.
    (i.e. If adding a 2-cell violates any of these conditions, undo. If there are no more moves left, backtrack. (use a memory stack for this))

    (3) Find (an instance of) the shortest cycle, remove the least frequent edge by merging two 2-cells and splitting in the "opposite" way.

    (4) Do similar operations to ensure orientable, no-fold, and no-pattern are satisfied.

    Potentially branch out and list many different ways of accomplishing (1) and (2).
